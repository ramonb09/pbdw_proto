    	<p>Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie. He didn't like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet. We heard it from three people so it must be true. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I mentioned Gatsby. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss. With an effort her wit rose faintly, We'll meet you on some corner. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. My dear, she cried, I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm through with it. I thought it was your secret pride. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Then you won't seem so stupid to yourself…Look at the mint! Wait a minute, snapped Tom, I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question. Miss Baker? he inquired. There's nothing we can do tonight.</p>
    	<p>We haven't met for many years, said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep. It's just a crazy old thing, she said. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with which he was to pay his way through. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war? Why, yes. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. There was a moment of silence. I live at West Egg. That was it. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression mad man as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning. You're not going to take care of her any more.</p>
    	<p>Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over. Anyhow he gives large parties, said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered: Oh, God! in a miserable way. Three o'clock, here at the house. The notion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as a place to have a mint julep. He wouldn't say another word. It's a bona fide deal. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called Wait!</p>
    	<p>I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool. He'd of helped build up the country. Or rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the living room. She's asleep. Then came the war, old sport. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing stunts all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. You'd better come home and get some sleep. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn't bear to shake him free. Does she want to see Gatsby? She's not to know about it. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair. We won't be late if we start now, she insisted aloud.</p>
